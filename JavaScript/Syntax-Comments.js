// Getting visual feedback in yout programs
/*
The first command we'll learn in JavaScript is console.log. This command
is used to print something onto the screen. As we write our first lines
of code, we'll be using console.log frequently as a way to visually see
the output of our programs.
 */
// Let's write our first program:
console.log("hello world");
console.log("how are you?");
// Executing the program above would print out the following:
/*
hello world
how are you?
 */

/*
Single-Line Comments
In JavaScript, you can denote single-line comments as double forward slashes, //. You can add them in as their own line, or tack it on the end of a line of code.

// This is a comment
console.log('Hello World!') // This is also another comment
Comments are also useful for disregarding lines of code that you don't want to be executed at this time.

// Not sure if I'm going to be using this code or not:
// console.log('Hello World!)
console.log('Goodbye Moon.')
The program above would only print:

Goodbye moon.
